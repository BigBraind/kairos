# Initiation

To start your Phoenix server:

  * cd into the `./lifecycle` directory
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
  * Run `mix tailwind.install` to download the standalone Tailwind CLI and generate a tailwind.config.js file in the `assets` directory.
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `PORT=4000 iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
